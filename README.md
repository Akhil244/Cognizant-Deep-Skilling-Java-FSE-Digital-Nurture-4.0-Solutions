# Cognizant Deep Skilling Java FSE â€“ Week 1 and 2 Code Recovery

## Context

This repository originally contained all Week 1 solutions

Due to a Git misconfiguration and accidental conflicts during version control operations, all of the Week 1 and 2 files were lost from the working directory.

## Actions Taken

- Rewrote all Week 2 solutions manually based on previously taken screenshots of working code and outputs.
- Renamed certain test classes to avoid name clashes and preserve clarity.
- Re-initialized the repository and committed the recovered code.

## Proof of Work

Screenshots of previously working test results and code are available and can be reviewed inside this repo for validation.

## Important Note

This is a recovery commit. The files lost during Git operations have been reconstructed with best effort and testing. Previous commit history was lost due to a forced reinitialization (`git init` and `.git` folder reset).
