# Cognizant Deep Skilling Java FSE – Week 2 Code Recovery

## Context

This repository originally contained all Week 2 solutions for JUnit, Mockito, and SLF4J exercises.

Due to a Git misconfiguration and accidental conflicts during version control operations, all Week 2 files were lost from the working directory.

## Actions Taken

- Rewrote all Week 2 solutions manually based on previously taken screenshots of working code and outputs.
- Verified correctness by recompiling and executing tests locally after rewriting.
- Renamed certain test classes to avoid name clashes and preserve clarity.
- Re-initialized the repository and committed the recovered code.
- All rewritten content has been tested and functions as expected.

## Proof of Work

Screenshots of previously working test results and code are available and can be shared on request for validation.

## Important Note

This is a recovery commit. The files lost during Git operations have been reconstructed with best effort and testing. Previous commit history was lost due to a forced reinitialization (`git init` and `.git` folder reset).
