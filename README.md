# Cognizant Deep Skilling Java FSE â€“ Week Code Recovery

## Context

This repository originally contained all solutions for Weeks 1 and 2 of the Java FSE Deep Skilling program. Due to a Git misconfiguration and accidental conflicts during version control operations, the project files were unintentionally removed from the working directory.

## Actions Taken

- Reconstructed all Week 2 code manually using previously captured screenshots of working code and terminal outputs.

- Verified functionality by successfully compiling and executing all test cases using Maven and JUnit.

- Renamed certain test files to maintain clarity and avoid name conflicts.

- Reinitialized the Git repository and committed the recovered code in a clean state.

- Restored the Maven project structure and confirmed compatibility with mvn clean compile test.

## Important Note

This is a recovery commit. The files lost during Git operations have been reconstructed with best effort and testing. Previous commit history might be lost due to a forced reinitialization (`git init` and `.git` folder reset).
